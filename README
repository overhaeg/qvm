A small Measurement Calculus interpreter using libquantum as quantum simulator backend.

Requires libquantum to be installed systemwide. Modify the Makefile to point to a different location than /usr/local/lib & /usr/local/include


'qvm' asks for a single s-expression on the standard input. The QVM uses the Measurement Calculus (by Danos et al.) as an instruction set.
example:
  echo '((E 1 2) (M 1 0) (X 2 (q 1)))' | ./qvm
